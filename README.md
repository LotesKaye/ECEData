# Introduction / Problem Statement

Unemployment is considered as a key measure of economic health. It becomes an indicator of the economic struggle of workers to obtain work and contribute to the economy of a country. It simply implies that the higher the unemployment rate, the less total economic production. The measure of unemployment excludes people who leave the labor force due to reasons like disability, pursuit of higher education, and retirement. Additionally, the unemployment rate is usually used as its key indicator, which is determined by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total labor force [1]. 

The project is about the analysis of world unemployment rates from 1991 to 2021. The aim of analyzing this problem is to gain insight into global employment trends over the last three decades and understand how various economic, social, and political issues influence employment rates. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) addressed by this project is SDG 8: "Decent Work and Economic Growth." This goal aims to foster long-term, inclusive, and sustained economic development, full and productive employment, and decent jobs for all [2].

Through the analysis of global unemployment rates, an in-depth analysis of the global employment landscape is provided as it correlates with this objective. It is also vital in promoting economic growth and ensuring that all individuals will have access to job opportunities.


# Review of Related Literature

**What Is Unemployment**
Unemployment serves as a crucial economic indicator, reflecting the capacity of workers to secure gainful employment and contribute to overall economic productivity. A higher number of unemployed individuals corresponds to a reduction in total economic production. Conversely, a low unemployment rate indicates that the economy is likely operating close to its full capacity, fostering increased output, wage growth, and elevated living standards. Nevertheless, an excessively low unemployment rate may signal potential challenges, such as an overheated economy, inflationary pressures, and tight labor conditions for businesses seeking additional workers. Balancing unemployment rates is essential for maintaining a healthy economic equilibrium that encourages sustainable growth and prosperity [3].


**Global unemployment rate 2003-2022**
In 2022, the global unemployment rate exhibited a notable decline, decreasing by 0.4 percentage points (-6.45 percent) compared to the previous year. The unemployment rate represents the proportion of the economically active population actively seeking employment but currently without work. It is important to note that this metric excludes economically inactive groups, including long-term unemployed individuals, children, and retirees. This decrease in the unemployment rate suggests a positive trend in economic conditions, reflecting an increase in employment opportunities for the actively engaged workforce worldwide [4].


**Youth Unemployment Causes and Solutions**
Globally, the reported figure of 73 million unemployed youth belies the actual extent of the issue, with 620 million identified as not in employment, education, or training (NEET) by the World Bank. The origins of youth unemployment are complex, rooted in various factors. The aftermath of the financial crisis exacerbated pre-existing challenges in labor markets and education systems, leading to precarious job opportunities. Widespread skills mismatch, attributed to inadequate vocational training and curricula misaligned with industry needs, further impedes young people. Additionally, the absence of entrepreneurship and lifeskills education, coupled with challenges in accessing capital for aspiring entrepreneurs, exacerbates the problem. In low-income countries, a digital divide compounds the skills gap, restricting opportunities for those lacking access to technology. Addressing these intertwined challenges is imperative for developing comprehensive global solutions to youth unemployment [5].


**Unemployment and mental health**
Unemployment, characterized by the absence of employment while actively seeking work, consistently associates with detrimental health outcomes. The negative impact encompasses stress, diminished self-esteem resulting from job loss, financial hardships, insecurity, and reduced future earnings potential. The social security system, involving processes like claims, work capability testing, and job search conditions, can exacerbate mental health challenges. Extended periods of unemployment worsen these consequences, impacting mental health, life satisfaction, and physical well-being. Prolonged pandemic-related restrictions, causing extended periods of reduced income and job loss, amplify concerns regarding the enduring health effects of such circumstances [6].


**Global Unemployment Crisis Continues**
Within the world's wealthiest nations, encompassing members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), approximately 34 million individuals find themselves unemployed. In the European Union, there has been a notable rise in unemployment over the past year, reaching an average of 11.3 percent of the workforce, with significant increases observed in countries such as France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden. In contrast, the United States has experienced intensified job creation, leading to a dip in unemployment below 5 percent. While both the U.S. and the United Kingdom have seen declines in unemployment rates, there is a simultaneous trend of widening income disparities in these countries [7].


**COVID-19 has led to massive job losses, particularly among youth and women**
In 2020, the global unemployment rate rose to 6.5 percent, marking a 1.1 percentage point increase from the previous year. The number of unemployed individuals worldwide surged by 33 million, reaching a total of 220 million, with an additional 81 million people exiting the labor market entirely. Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as Europe and Northern America, experienced unemployment rate hikes of at least 2 percentage points. Notably, youth and women faced disproportionate impacts, with employment losses of 8.7 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively, compared to 3.7 percent for adults and 3.9 percent for men. Before the pandemic, youth unemployment was already three times higher than that of adults. The crisis prompted more women than men to leave the labor force for childcare responsibilities, exacerbating longstanding gender gaps in labor force participation rates [8].
